# Jogo de Mímica (Mimics) em React

Jogo simples de Mímica feito em React com uso de Hooks.

O jogo possui uma lista de palavras, uma palavra é sorteada a cada rodada, onde uma pessoa do time deve tentar fazer seu time advinhar a palavra fazendo mímica (não vale falar!). Cada rodada tem um tempo limite, se o time não conseguir acertar a palavra antes do tempo acabar, perde sua vez e é a vez do outro time, onde será sorteada nova palavra.

É simulada uma chamada a uma Mock API para pegar as palavras, para que seja realizado o tratamento de chamadas assíncronas dentro de um Hook (useEffect).

Além disso, também são implementadas rotas, com react-router-dom, para uma página de instruções.

O jogo pode ser acessado online neste link: https://react-mimics.vercel.app/.

Abaixo, você encontra instruções padrão do React para rodar localmente.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
